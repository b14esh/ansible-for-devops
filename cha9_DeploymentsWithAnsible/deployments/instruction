# Provisioning Plan
1. Install git (app is version controlled)
2. Install Node.js (compilation requires Javascript)
3. Install Ruby
4. Install Passenger with Nginx
5. Install any dependencies and prepare the server for deployment

# Deployment Plan
1. Use git to check out latest production release
2. Copy over a secrets.yml template with secure app data required for
running the app
3. Make sure all the gems required for the app are installed (via Bundler)
4. Create the database (if it doesnt already exist).
5. Run rake tasks to make sure the database scheme is up-to-date and all assets
(like JS and CSS) are compiled
6. Make sure the app files ownership is set correctly so Passenger and Nginx
serve them without error.
7. If any changes or updates were made restart Passenger and Nginx
